Description:
This is project number three focused on helping me learn how to work with Laravel Framework, manage dependencies using composer, deploy a live application to digital ocean, use routes and incorporate views into applications.  On the welcome page there are links to two applications that I created.  First application is to generate Lorem-ipsum paragraphs.  The user can select how many paras they desire along with options such as header, para's length and all caps.  The second application is to generate random users.  The user can select how many new users they need along with options such as DOB, profile, company and address.

Plugins, libraries, package or outside code:
Yes, two plugins were used.  I used the loripsum.net API (please see loripsum.net) and Fzaninotto/Faker PHP (please https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) package.  I used css3buttongenerator.com to help me create a button css, though I did end up updating it later.
